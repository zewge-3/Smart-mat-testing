# Smart-mat-testing
Create a service that uses AI to analyze materials testing data (e.g., stress, fatigue, corrosion) and generate reports or insights.

## 1. User Workflow & Outputs
### A. File Upload & Analysis
Users (labs, manufacturers) log in or sign up.
They upload materials testing data files (CSV, Excel, or images of samples).
The system confirms successful upload.
### B. AI-Driven Analysis
The backend sends uploaded data to the AI microservice.
The AI analyzes the data (e.g., stress, fatigue, corrosion values; defect classification from images).
Output: An analysis result (summary, charts, insights, defect detection info).
### C. Automated Reporting
The platform generates a report:
Key findings (e.g., max stress, fatigue life, detected corrosion, etc.)
Data visualization (charts, graphs—can be added later)
Recommendations or flags (if defects or failures are detected)
Output: Downloadable report (PDF, JSON, dashboard view).
### D. Historical Records
Users can view or download past reports.
Each report is linked to a user account.
## 2. Technical Outputs
### Frontend:

Modern dashboard UI
File upload form
Analysis results and report viewer
Login/signup pages
### Backend:

REST API endpoints for upload, analysis, report generation, authentication
Database storing users and reports
Connection to AI microservice
### AI Microservice:

Receives data
Returns analysis (mocked or real ML model output)
## 3. What You’ll See in Action
#### Uploading a test file
→ You see a progress bar or confirmation.

#### Clicking “Analyze”
→ You see analysis results (summary, details).

#### Downloading a report
→ You get a PDF or JSON file summarizing the findings.

#### Logging in/out
→ Secure user sessions.

#### Viewing past analyses
→ List of previous reports, with download links.

## 4. Example Output (for a sample upload)
Code
Report for Sample 12345
-----------------------
- Maximum Stress: 250 MPa
- Fatigue Life Estimate: 10,000 cycles
- Corrosion Detected: No
- Defect Classification: Surface Crack

Recommendations:
- Material passes standard requirements.
- No further action needed.
Or a dashboard view with charts and downloadable files.

## 5. For Developers
Working React frontend and Express backend.
Flask (Python) AI microservice.
API calls connecting all parts.
Deployed web app accessible at your chosen URLs.
